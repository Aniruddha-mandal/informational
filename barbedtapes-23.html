    <p class="barbed-tapes"><img class="tapes" src="../webpage-delta/Razor-Wire-Topping-0081-1.jpg"height=300 width="300">Barbed tape or razor wire is a mesh of metal strips with sharp edges whose 
        purpose is to prevent passage by humans. The term "razor wire", through long usage, has generally been used to describe barbed 
        tape products. While razor wire is much sharper than the standard barbed wire, it is named after its appearance, but is not actually
         razor sharp. However, the points are very sharp and made to rip and grab onto clothing and flesh. The multiple blades of a razor wire
          fence are designed to inflict serious cuts on anyone attempting to climb through and therefore have a strong psychological deterrent
           effect. In many high-security applications, barbed tape supplanted barbed wire, which could be circumvented relatively quickly by humans
            with tools, while penetrating razor wire barriers without tools is very slow and difficult, giving security forces more time to respond.
         Razor wire contains a core hardened steel strip that is often under tension, so if cut, it strikes the cutter.</p>
